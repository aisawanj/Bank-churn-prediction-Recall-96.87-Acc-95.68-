# Bank churn prediction 


This project uses machine learning, which involves analyzing customer data to identify those most likely to leave the bank, using a total of 14 models to test. From testing, it was found that the best models obtained are XGBoost and Random Forest as the best algorithms to predict Bank Customer Churn since they have the highest accuracy (95.68% and 95.32%), XGBoost and Random Forest produced almost perfect ROC-AUC scores of 0.9895 and 0.9879 in test data, respectively. This means that the model works well in predicting each class.
